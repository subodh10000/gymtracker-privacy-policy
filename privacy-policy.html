as part of normal app use.
</p>

<h2>4. Backend Processing (Workout Plan Generation)</h2>

During the initial workout plan generation process, certain profile or preference information may be temporarily

GymTrackerApp does not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.
</p>

<h2>6. User Control and Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
You may delete your data at any time by resetting the App’s data (if the App provides a reset option) or by
uninstalling the App from your device.
</p>

<h2>7. Notifications</h2>
<p>
GymTrackerApp may request permission to send you optional local notifications to support your fitness routine.
These notifications are scheduled and delivered entirely on your device and do not require server communication.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Workout Reminders:</strong> Daily reminders to encourage you to complete your planned workout for the day.
    Reminder messages may reference the general workout focus for the day to help keep you motivated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hydration Reminders:</strong> Daily reminders to encourage regular hydration as part of a healthy fitness routine.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notification Control:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Notification permission is requested during onboarding and is entirely optional.</li>
  <li>You can enable or disable notifications at any time through your device’s settings (Settings &gt; GymTrackerApp &gt; Notifications).</li>
  <li>If notifications are disabled, the App will continue to function normally.</li>
  <li>No personal data is transmitted to external servers to deliver notifications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>11. International Users</h2>
<p>
If you are using the App from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be
temporarily transmitted to and processed in the United States (US Central region) to generate your personalized
workout plan. This occurs only during the initial setup process. Your data is not stored on the server after the
workout plan is generated. By using the App, you consent to this temporary transfer for the purpose of generating
your workout plan.
